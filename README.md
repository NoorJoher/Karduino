# Karduino

Microcontrollers are used widely now days in different applications, such as home automation, device control, wireless sensor network, and also for industrial applications. Generally, the microcontrollers that used in industrial application must have a number of properties to fit with industrial enviroment, such as reliability and robustness. 
One of the most common microcontrollers platforms is the Arduino, which is an ATMega based microcontroller. There are a number of industrial microcontroller platforms that is based on Arduino or ATMega chip due to its number of specifications like efficiency and simplicity. Among them we mention: M-DUINO58, Iono Uno, Controllino, Arduino Industrial 101, Industruino and Ruggeduino-ET.
However, there are several advantages and disadvantages in the mentioned products, which highlight the map of the problem statement and the proposal of this thesis. 
This thesis analyses the current products and does a cross section of the best properties of these products and also to address the limitations. Hence, this work can be used as a guideline to propose a new ATMega based microcontroller platform with the best combination of features. 
As an output oof this work, a highly adaptable open-source platform, which is referred to as Karduino, is designed and implemented. This product has been developed as an open-source to engage the community in the future development process and to support its sustainability. 
Comparative results revealed the distinctive attributes of the Karduino comparted to general industrial board specifications. More specifically, the device power supply is improved, as well as the mechanical properties of the device are improved too, such as antivibration, connections reliability, outdoor compatibility, and finally, the cost is considered as an important factor of Karduino design.
The findings and insights obtained through this research provide valuable knowledge for enhancing microcontroller design in industrial applications. Furthermore, this research sets the stage for future explorations and developments in the field of industrial automation and control systems.

## Content

This repo consists the schematic and PCB design of Karduino board. They can be found in `board` folder in two types, `Altium` and `EasyEDA`. The encloser stl files also can be found in `encloser` folder. Gerber files, pdf exports and other related files could be found in [releases](https://github.com/NoorJoher/Karduino/releases) page.

## How to use?

It is recommended to use [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) to view or edit the design as it was designed using it. At the [editor](https://easyeda.com/editor), open the document via top menu => `File` => `Open` => `EasyEDA`, and select the json file, then open it at the editor, you can then save it into a project.
